This project now uses the Siccity GLTFUtility package via Package Manager.
A shim file previously existed here but was removed to allow the package to be used.

If Unity Package Manager does not automatically resolve the package, open `Window -> Package Manager` and click the + -> Add package from git URL and paste:
https://github.com/Siccity/GLTFUtility.git
